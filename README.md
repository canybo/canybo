- Hi, I’m canybo!
- I’m interested in coding; I love the problem solving that accompanies code, and see potential in computer science as my future.
- I’m currently learning whatever I find interesting. I am familiar with Java but want to branch out my skills. I am a beginner programmer.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything really!
