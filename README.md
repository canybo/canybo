- Hi, I’m Christian!
- I’m interested in Computer Science; I love the problem solving that accompanies code, and see potential in computer science as my future.
- I am a Junior Computer Science student at Clemson University. I have so far loved my time at Clemson and am eager to learn much more as I pursue my degree.
- Outside of the classroom, I’m currently learning whatever I find interesting.
- I am familiar with Java, C, and C++, but want to branch out and learn many more skills.
- I am open to collaboration in any regard.
